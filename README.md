This is the course project for Cmpt 291 - Introduction to Relational Databases. It is a functional rental agency program, which allows users to either rent vehicles under a profile as a customer, or view/manage data as an employee. The interface was designed in Visual Studios in C#, and the database that this pulls from is a SQL Server.
